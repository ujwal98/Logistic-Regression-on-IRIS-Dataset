# Logistic-Regrssion-on-IRIS-Dataset
Logistic Regression to classify the IRIS Dataset

This dataset contains data of different species of IRIS and our job is classify them into different species based on the sepal length, sepal width, petal length and petal width of the IRIS flowers.

# Inputs
The inputs to our model will be sepal length, sepal width, petal length and petal width.

# Output
The output of our model will be the name of the species of the plant (Iris-setosa,Iris-versicolor,Iros-virginicia).

# Dataset
The Dataset that I've used is from kaggle. It contains data of 150 different samples.

# Model
The model used in this code is LogisticRegression from sklearn.linear_model
